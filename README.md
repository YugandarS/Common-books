# Optimizing-Common-books

In this project we optimize code to find or obtain a list of common books.

To find the common book IDs in "books_published_last_two_years.txt" and "all_coding_books.txt" to obtain a list of recent coding books. 

Download the notebook file "optimizing_code_common_books.ipynb" and the text files. Open the notebook file using the Jupyter Notebook.
